        <h2>My Top 5 Books</h2>
        <div id="content">
            <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1305.Gates_of_Fire" target="_blank">Gates of Fire</a></h3>
                A story about Spartans. Tragic and dramatic.

            <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696006-being-mortal" target="_blank">Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</a></h3>
                    The most helpful and profound book I've ever read in my life.

                    Atul Gawande did a great job collecting the hardships people face during their lives.

                    I had finished it shortly after my mom's death and it'd helped me accept that everyone sooner or later dies.

                    I highly recommend it if you or your relatives/friends face critical health issues.

                    Really, the author — practicing surgeon — in a down-to-earth manner writes about heart-breaking cases which include a story of his father. Such courage makes this book very intimate and destroys the boundaries between the author and the reader.

                    I suggest that someday Being Mortal will be translated into Russian or Ukrainian so I can buy that book for my grandma.

            <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/929782.Martin_Eden" target="_blank">Martin Eden</a></h3>
                    Ambitious and uneducated Martin Eden sets on his journey to live in love with Ruth Morse.

                    Full of touching moments and drama, this book broke my heart more than once.

            <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication" target="_blank">Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life</a></h3>
                    Must-read for every person in this world. Helps find a common ground with most aggressive people, and evaluate your own flows.
            <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24618.The_Art_of_Living" target="_blank">The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness</a></h3>
                    This book shaped my mindset, and helped me to realize I'm interested in the Buddhist path.
